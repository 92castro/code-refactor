# Horiseon Code Refactor

## My Task

Horiseon reached out because they were having an issue on their webpage. Their webpage looked great but a link was not working when you tried to click it. While working on the issue, I also went in and made some changes in the code and adding notes of the changes. The changes I made were:

- HTML semantics
  - replacing div to section
- Condensing the styling in the CSS file
  - having one class instead of multiple
- Added the alt attribute
  - if the image does not load

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
